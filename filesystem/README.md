Filesystem
==========

This project is a small API for a virtual filesystem written in C. The filesystem
uses a FAT style allocation table and inode like structures for storing file
metadata. The API supports creating directories, opening files, and read/writing
to files. Also included is a formatting utility. Note this project was completed
as an assignment for my Operating Systems course.
