Sprite Framework
================

A simple sprite animation framework written in plain JavaScript. The framework defines three types of objects Sprites, Animations, and Animators. The Sprite class represents the HTML element of the sprite and its state. The Animation class is used to specify a single animation such as run, jump, or idle. An Animator class associates an event with some action, like the movement of a sprite, and usually triggers an animation. You can see a demo and more detail on the index.html demo page. Note this project was written for my client-side scripting course.
